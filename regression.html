          The colonizer was the adult.<br>
          <br>
          A flurry of invention<br>
          Novelty run amok<br>
          He stood astride the continent<br>
          Leaving a rock-solid foundation for child-scholars<br>
          He learned at home and taught abroad<br>
          Mastery embodied<br>
          <br>
          An agonizing moment of self-doubt paralyzed him<br>
          To pick up the pieces, to leave the pieces where they lay<br>
          He knew them better than they knew themselves<br>
          But the trap was laid, the infestation given sustenance<br>
          What he brought, they took<br>
          <br>
          He despised his new neighbors despite his enlightenment<br>
          He had taught but must he learn?<br>
          They tried teaching him but his mind wasn’t in it<br>
          Mastery threatened<br>
          <br>
          They laugh and carry on in their Brooklyn barber shops<br>
          They know him, they learned what he taught<br>
          He doesn’t know them, he didn’t learn what they tried to teach<br>
          Now his shadowy naivete looms to infect with ignorance<br>
          <br>
          The colonizer is the child.
